In addition to traditional talks and lectures, the aim of the **on-method** series is to stage productive *encounters* between theory and method, connecting top theorists and model-makers with makers of things, builders of code, and architects of the pixel.

In each encounter, we ask our guest to provide a brief (15-30 min) *prompt*, a problem, or a provocation. We will then meet, talk, imagine, and speculate as a group. Expect a discussion that flows into diagrams, maps, and word trees. These will be further refined into focused *experiments* that may take shape as physical artifacts or data, "white" papers, visualizations, robots, manifestos, or circuit boards.
