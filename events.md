While much time has been spent theorizing the “digital” in Digital Humanities, this series seeks to gain a greater understanding of the heritage and future of humanistic inquiry writ large. **On Method in the Humanities** will examine the range of theoretical and practical methods used by humanities scholars and critics, past and present. Following Thomas Kuhn, can we outline paradigms of humanistic inquiry? What are the national specificities of these methods? How are the technological challenges and opportunities provided by new research methods (computational, quantitative) and new organizational structures (labs, workshops, co-working) tethered to epistemological shifts as well?
