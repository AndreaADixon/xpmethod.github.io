<!-- A 75-100 word paragraph describing the motivation behind these projects -->
Methodology in the humanities is often presented in theory, but in Digital Humanities it is just as often developed in practice---in a toolkit, a network visualization, or a thousand lines of code. This research cluster showcases emerging methodologies in action, projects that offer new ways of doing scholarly work. Can **new research methods** in computational and quantitative humanities lead to new epistemologies? Where are the frontiers of large-scale text analysis, computational social science, and quantitative literary history, and what will the next frontier be? How can cultural criticism and computer science educate each other?
