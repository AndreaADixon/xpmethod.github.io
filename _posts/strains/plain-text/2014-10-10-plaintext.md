<!-- A 75-100 word paragraph describing the motivation behind these projects -->
Plain text is a file format and a frame of mind. A fundamental idea in the development of computing, plain text stands in opposition to closed ecosystems, rarefied knowledge, and black-box devices. Instead, it offers a vision of data that is human-readable by design, portable, concise, and universal. In a series of workshops, lectures, and events, we seek to empower a community of students, scholars, authors, publishers, librarians, citizens, and activists by re-imagining the tools and the practices that shape our daily encounters with information.
