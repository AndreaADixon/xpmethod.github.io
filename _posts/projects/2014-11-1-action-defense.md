Problem: Following the turmoil of gameragate our friends at \#feminism.com are getting hacked. Whatever your views on the situation, it is our duty to protect free speech online. Action Defense is first, an all-nighter code-fest to move #feminism to a secure, static, hacker-proof platform and second, the attempt to articulate online security basics for the wider activist community.
