Scholars in all disciplines are expert knowledge workers. We are good at finding, accessing, and storing information, usually in textual form. But much of the world's knowledge is not secreted as text. It is palpable, tacit, and material. Stories and histories of such objects and techniques do not usually find themselves into the history books.[^1] And we have no universal catalog of objects. No way to consult and to retrieve their material contexts (outside of museums and private collections).

What happens when we encounter an unknown object? How can we incorporate it into the more privileged histories of technology and material culture? Inspired by movements like citizen science[^2] and by civic-minded uses of collective intelligence and crowd-sourcing,[^3] in this experiment, we would like to imagine something akin to "citizen scholarship" or "citizen humanities"---a methodologically rigorous way to ask the public at large for help in solving strange and fascinating mysteries confronted by historians, media theorists, and literary scholars alike.

Our first mission: to **identify "Mystery Object 40.9.11"** in the collections of the Henry Ford Museum in Detroit.  In the summer of 1915, a wireless telegraph station in Sayville, Long Island owned by the German company Telefunken was [caught sending covert commands](theappendix.net/issues/2014/7/the-invention-of-wireless-cryptography) to U-Boats patrolling the Atlantic.  Precisely how the Germans cryptographically hid their communications right under everyone’s noses in the United States---and in turn, above their heads---remains a mystery.

Today, the Ford Museum holds a collection of equipment confiscated by the US Navy from the Telefunken stations at Sayville, another in Tuckerton, New Jersey, as well as several devices from Charles Apgar, the amateur experimenter who recorded the wireless telegraph signals sent from Sayville on wax phonography cylinders and turned them over to the American government.  These were the first ever recording of a radio broadcast.

One of the objects in this collection has given the intriguing name ["Mystery Object 40.9.11,"](http://collections.thehenryford.org/Collection.aspx?keywords=40.9.11) a light-tight wooden box containing a neon yellow, paper tape reel.  When the Museum’s conservation department initially opened the box, the paper tape began fading to a near-white pale yellow, leading them to believe that the tape was treaded with cyanide.  Kristen Gallerneaux, Curator of Communication and IT at the Henry Ford Museum, first thought of the cyanotype process.  But her search for evidence of cyanotype paper-tape devices in radio and wireless history came up with nothing.

Kristen describes here the curatorial process thus far:
 
> The conservation department did a bunch of in-house tests with tiny pieces of the paper. They applied heat, light, acids, solvents, and even some kind of ‘smell test’ where they light the material on fire in a glass jar and then sniff the fumes to try and detect certain odors. None came up positive for cyanide. We sometimes work with the Detroit Institute of Art’s Conservation lab, where they have different equipment. They were able to determine that bromides were present in the paper. This made total sense, as silver bromide processes were another one of those alternative early photo processes that would have been in use in the 1900-1930 range.
 
> I did a little more research, and the lead of bromide solution on paper tape led me to conclude that the object is related to high-speed phototelegraphy—likely operating in conjunction with photoelectric cells and a ‘developer’ that came from the same accession. The box is light tight, painted black on the interior with red safety glass. I asked a retired electrical engineer if there were any minute mechanisms (electrostatic producing, etc) that I wasn’t seeing, and he said it was basically a ‘feeder box’ that would have led out to other components.
 
> We’re currently doing a few more tests on the organic materials present – rubber, wood, and Bakelite – to try and pin it down to a more exact timeframe. So, many overlapping museuological forensic conundrums here, and I’ve had to embrace that [the] “Mystery Objects will continue to remain [a mystery] that much longer. For now, it is a wooden “black box” (literally and metaphorically) that held chemical recording tape, of potentials that never happened.

To solve the mystery of the black box we turn to the following communities:
