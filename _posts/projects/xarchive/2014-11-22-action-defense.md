Following the turmoil of `[#gameragate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamergate_controversy)` our friends at `hashtagfeminism.com` are getting hacked. It is our duty as citizens of the internet to protect free speech online. Action Defense is first, an all-nighter code-fest to move `#feminism` to a secure, static, hacker-proof platform and second, the attempt to articulate online security basics for the wider activist community. Join us!
