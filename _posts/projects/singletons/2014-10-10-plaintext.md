Plain text is a file format and a frame of mind. As a file format, it contains
nothing but a "pure sequence of character codes." In technical terms, it stands
in opposition to *fancy text*: "text representation consisting of plain text
plus added information."[^ln-uni] Yet, plain text is not without its own forms
of mediation. All matter-bound inscription must take on some added properties
of its preferred medium, however contingent these may be. The simplicity of
plain text signifies systematic minimalism with a view towards human legibility
and not towards that of a system or a machine.

As a frame of mind, the use of plain text signals an ethics of reading and
writing. Added information routinely embedded in all forms of contemporary
textuality can include more than innocuous document attributes like "font size"
or "line spacing." Increasingly, devices that mediate literary activity encode
forms of governance, like the enforcement of intellectual property rights and
censorship. The use of plain text therefore entails the making visible of
implicit governing structures. It implies also that computational control is
available for *computational hermeneutics*. Building on the recent work of
scholars like Wendy Hui Kyong Chun, Alexander Galloway, Matthew Kirschenbaum,
and Lisa Gitelman, I contend that textual legibility is becoming increasingly
crucial to a critical understanding of what it means to remain human in a
digital world.

*Plain Text* enacts a reconciliation of vocabularies. It is a response to a
particular situation of a literary scholar encountering the field of software
engineering. For a long stretch of my professional life, these two areas of
activity remained separate. I worked at one and I studied the other. At the
time, I simply did not think that code had anything to do with poetry. The idea
for the book came to me in a moment of realization after I was asked one of
those naive but fundamental questions of the kind that can set research in
motion down a long and winding path. A childhood friend who loves books asked
about the difference between text in print and text on the screen. It was in
that struggle to articulate the difference that I realized that some of my
deepest assumptions about literature relied on the centuries-long stability of
print media. Despite my professional experience as a programmer, I could
not readily explain the mechanisms by which keystrokes turned into pixels,
pixels into letters, and letters into words. I could recount technical detail
on some level, but my knowledge also had huge gaps. It did not amount to a
coherent story. I was, despite my best efforts, surrounded by magical lanterns
that cast shadows of code and poetry.

Initially, at the point of contact, the two selves spoke different languages.
It was and continues to be a disconcerting process by which things dear and
familiar to me, in both worlds, grew strange and unfamiliar, showing themselves
to be sometimes less than and sometimes more than I comfortably expected.
Nothing could be assumed from the start. Field specific jargon, down to the
naive foundations, had to be examined for hidden assumptions that prevented
congruence. With time, I understood that code and poetry have everything to do
with one another.

Lev Manovich once described his massive image panoramas[^ln-mano] as an
artifact of an alien life in the process of observing the human condition. My
other compatriot and mentor Svetlana Boym also considered her estrangement a
methodology, applicable to life and scholarship.[^ln-boym] Defamiliarization
plays an instrumental part of an immigrant's survival mechanism. The digitally
displaced similarly hold on to the discomfort of the encounter with the
machine.  Estrangement---always at the heart of immigrant or queer
poetics---reconciles without seeking wholeness or integration. I dedicate this
book then to queers and immigrants, literal and figurative---spatial, literary,
technological---to those being displaced unwillingly, to those exiled within
and without, to those who understand the need for displacement, to those who
transgress purposefully, and to those willing to trespass.

My own trespassing converged on plain text as a primitive field of activity, at
the crossroads of software engineering and the study of literature. There, I
found plain text to matter because how it is encoded, transmitted, and stored
decides who gets to decode, to receive, and to access.
