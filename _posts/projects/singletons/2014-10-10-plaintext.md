Much of today's textual and literary activity passes through some form of
digital being. Yet, the material contexts of digital knowledge production
remain obscured and in need of increased critical scrutiny. In peeling back the
layers of technology and cultural technique that constitute contemporary
encounter with text, "Plain Text" seeks to reconfigure familiar terms that
motivate the study of new media, literature, and the digital humanities. The
book unfolds a philosophical investigation of digital being through a media
history of plain text, an important file in the development of computer history
extant on every digital device destined for human-computer interaction.

Plain text is a file format and a frame of mind. A foundational concept in the
development of computing, plain text stands in opposition to ways of thinking
that have produced closed platforms, rarefied knowledge, and black-box devices.
Instead, it offers a vision of data that is human-readable by design: portable,
concise, and universal. This book contains a history of and an argument for
plain text. In making my case, I seek to convene a community interested in
reflecting critically on the ideas, tools, and practices that shape our daily
encounter with computation.
