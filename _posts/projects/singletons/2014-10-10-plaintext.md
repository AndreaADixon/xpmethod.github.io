Plain text is a file format and a frame of mind. A fundamental concept in the
development of computing, plain text stands in opposition to closed platforms,
rarefied knowledge, and black-box devices. Instead, it offers a vision of data
that is human-readable by design: portable, concise, and universal. This book
contains an argument for plain text. In doing so, it seeks to convene a
community interested in reflecting critically on the ideas, tools, and
practices that shape our daily encounter with computation. My argument starts
with foundational principles at the intersection of media theory and
information science. I ask: what is at stake in the difference between digital
and analog media?  What contains more information a novel or a block of wood?
What separates meaning, form, and formatting? How do pixels form into texts?
Where does data end and meta-data begin? To what extent media determine the
message? The formulation of these broadly theoretical concerns about the
poetics of human-computer interaction opens the way to a discussion about the
social impact of textual technology, as it relates to applied dynamics of
online agency, deliberation, consensus-making, and dissent.

A secondary aim of this volume is to convince computer "users" to view their
computational environments as a literary system of sorts. I mean a "literary
system" in opposition to what one might conventionally mistake for a "binary"
or "digital" one, however imprecise those terms are in everyday use. In
clarifying usage, I will ask mere "users" to become close readers, thinkers,
and makers of technology, able to apply the same critical acuity to reading
code and platform as they do to close reading of prose and poetry. Ultimately,
the book makes a case for the recovery of textual roots latent in the
mechanisms of modern computing.
