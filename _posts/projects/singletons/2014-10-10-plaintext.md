Plain text is a file format and a frame of mind. As a file format, it contains
nothing but a "pure sequence of character codes." In technical terms, it stands
in opposition to *fancy text*: "text representation consisting of plain text
plus added information."[^ln-uni] As a frame of mind, it indicates a preference
for human-readable input and output, for computational tools that are simple
and elegant, and for open systems that are transparent to the user. The book
unfolds a history of and an argument for plain text. In making my case, I argue
that "other information" routinely embedded in all forms of contemporary
textuality includes much more than instructions for "font size" and "paragraph
justification." Increasingly, devices that mediate literary activity encode
specific models of governance and control.

The central concern of the book is to dispel the illusion of verisimilitude
between text on paper and text on the screen. The words may look the same, but
the underlying material affordances of the medium differ in significant
details. As an obvious example, consider a news report that changes slightly
based on the reader's location, or an e-book reader device that highlights
popular passages. For a literary scholar, such instability of medium means
analysis cannot be confined to reading for meaning alone. How will close
reading persist, when the reading device reconfigures a text dynamically, to
fit individual taste, mood, or politics? The formulation of this narrowly
literary-theoretical concern leads to the broader question of empowered
human--computer interaction. Building on the work of scholars like Jerome
McGann, Wendy Hui Kyong Chun, Katherine Hayles, Matthew Kirschenbaum, Lori
Emerson, Lisa Gitelman, and Johanna Drucker, I contend that textual legibility
is becoming increasingly crucial to a critical understanding of what it means
to remain human in a digital world.

The book is structured along a trajectory that begins at the material
foundations of modern textual technology, moving from the level of circuit and
silicon, and reaching up, through levels of abstraction (files, folders, and
operating systems), towards the reader. In following that path, I reconstruct
the passage of an electron from the mechanical action of the keyboard, to
magnetic storage medium, and to liquid crystal, that together give rise to
pixels, letters, and words. In using this approach, my book introduces a method
of literary microanalysis. Where distant reading perceives patterns across
large-scale literary copora, microanalysis breaks textuality down to its minute
constituent components. It is at this level, that I find that readers and
writers are in danger of becoming fundamentally alienated from the immediate
material contexts of knowledge production.
