*Plain Text* enacts a reconciliation of vocabularies. As such, it is a response
to a particular situation of a software engineer encountering a literary
scholar. For a long stretch of my professional life, these two roles remained
separate from each other. I worked at one and I studied another. At the time, I
simply did not think that code has anything to do with poetry. The idea for the
book came to me in a moment of realization, after I was asked one of those
naive but fundamental questions, of the kind that can plunge research into a
long and winding hole. A childhood friend who loves books asked about the
difference between text in print and text on the screen. It was in that
struggle to articulate difference that I realized that some of my deepest
assumptions about literature relied on the centuries-long stability of print
media. And, despite my professional experience as a programmer, I could not
readily explain the mechanisms by which keystrokes turned into pixels, pixels
into letters, and letters into words. I could recount much technical detail on
some level, but my knowledge also had huge gaps and did not amount to a
coherent story. I was, despite my best efforts, surrounded by magical lanterns
that cast shadows of code and poetry.

Initially, at the point of contact, the two selves spoke different languages.
It was and continues to be a disconcerting process, by which things dear and
familiar to me, in both worlds, grew strange and unfamiliar, revealing
themselves to be sometimes less than and sometimes more than I comfortably
expected. Nothing could be assumed from the start. Field specific jargon, down
to the naive foundations, had to be unpacked and examined for hidden
assumptions that prevented congruence. With time, I understood that code and
poetry have everything to do with each other.

Lev Manovich once described his massive image panoramas as an artifact of an
alien life in the process of observing the human condition. My other compatriot
and sometimes mentor, Svetlana Boym, also considers her estrangement as a
methodology, applicable to life and scholarship. Defamiliarization plays an
instrumental part of an immigrant's survival mechanism. The digitally displaced
similarly hold on to the discomfort of the encounter with the machine.
Estrangement---always at the heart of immigrant or queer poetics---reconciles
without seeking wholeness and integration. I dedicate this book then to queers
and immigrants, literal and figurative---spatial, literary, technological---to
those being displaced unwillingly, to those exiled within and without, to those
who understand the need for displacement, to those who transgress purposefully,
and to those willing to trespass.

My own trespassing converged on plain text as a primitive field of activity,
where literary scholarship and software engineering intersect. Much of the book
will consist of the drawing out of what that intersection entails. On some
level, *Plain Text* is a book about the link between textual encoding and
literary interpretation. The reader should not however expect a totalizing
history of modern computing or a survey of textual theory. Rather, the argument
progresses from the action of the alphanumerical keyboard switch, through
copper and silicon to the floating gate and the liquid crystal, and on towards
the human. It is but a single possible pass through a cavernous black box: a
recollection of a passage which left behind traces of illumination, reflecting
the vagrancies of the journey.

Plain text is a file format and a frame of mind. As a file format, it contains
nothing but a "pure sequence of character codes." In technical terms, it stands
in opposition to *fancy text*: "text representation consisting of plain text
plus added information."[^ln-uni] Yet, plain text is not without its own forms
of mediation. All matter-bound inscription must take on some added properties
of its preferred medium, however contingent these may be. The simplicity of
plain text signifies systematic minimalism with the view towards human
legibility, and not towards that of a system or a machine. In this encoded
preference for legibility of a specific kind, plain text, I argue, contains a
model of humanity. A part of the book's job will be to recover and to describe
that model.

As a frame of mind, the use of plain text signals an ethics of reading and
writing. The book unfolds a history of and an argument for plain text, as a
mode of preferred engagement---an interface---with the word. That engagement,
as I will argue, must be made visible, because "added information" routinely
embedded in all forms of contemporary textuality can include more than
innocuous instructions for document attributes like "font size" or "paragraph
justification." Increasingly, devices that mediate literary activity encode
specific forms of governance and control.

To trace the flows of governance and control that lurk beneath the text, of the
sort that Friedrich Kittler warns us, must mean more than passive apprehension
of footprints indicating the "evanescent absence" of life.[^ln-lacan] Unlike
Kittler, who once wrote that "under conditions of high technology, literature
has nothing more to say,"[@kittler_gramophone_1999, 263] I believe that
literature thrives. But the advent of computational textuality also means that
the reading of texts may also involve the proactive deployment of tools like
*tracert*, *xxd*, *pcap*, *ssh*, or *traceroute*. These tools "hop" across,
"sniff" packets in, burrow through, survey, traverse, and flood network
topographies. Plain text channels itinerant streams of data back into mangroves
of comprehension *for* readers and writers (as the very subjects whose loss
Kittler laments). Only in such encrypted tunnels and secure shells can anything
like the digital humanities take root.
