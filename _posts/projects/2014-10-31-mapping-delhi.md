One of my central concerns has been to think about medieval and early modern conceptions of space---place, landscape, and affective resonances around built environment. I am dis-satisfied with the established practice of scanning maps, geo-tagging them to known geography, and attaching text layers. 

##Earlier
An early effort was to take eighteenth- and nineteenth-century maps of Delhi and render them according to spatial descriptions in textual accounts of the city. We considered creating and structuring an archive of Delhi that combined maps, historical texts, and rich along with scholarly commentary and annotations. Our sources included Persian histories of Delhi, such as the *Salih-e Amal* by Kanbo, the *Maâ€™asir ul Umara*, and travel accounts such as the memoirs of Bernier, Tavernier, and Dargah Quli Khan. We added detailed descriptions of Delhi by Mirza Sangin Beg, Sir Sayyid Ahmad Khan and Bashir ud Din Ahmad. All of this information was encoded on Mughal maps of Shahjahanabad and earlier maps of the city commissioned by British imperial administrations.

While this added a much needed spatiality to modern and early modern texts, the question of the medieval understanding of space remained for me. I began to think of space and place as nodes of an organizational chart. 

##Now
My new effort is to represent places in al-Baladhuri's Kitab Futuh al-Buldan as an organizational chart jettisoning the artificiality of the cartographic imagination. We are discussing how lines, shapes, distortions, elevation as well as colors and textures can be used to make **Argumentative Maps** which do spatialize the narrative without flattening it. Here the scholar will encode into numerical data aesthetic, political, social, cultural information in the narrative. Critically this numerical encoding will be the argument made by the scholar, and open to debate and re-interpretation (just as a scholarly narrative would be). My effort here will get closer to seeing *how* medieval and early modern representations of space can be visualized but also towards making *argumentative* dh projects - projects which go beyond scan and post.
