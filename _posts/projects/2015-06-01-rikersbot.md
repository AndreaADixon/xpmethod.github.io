## Description

*Rikers Bot* is a joint project between [Columbia's Group for Experimental
Methods in the Humanties](http://xpmethod.plaintext.in/) and the [Center for
Justice](http://centerforjustice.columbia.edu/). It aims to provide the young
people at Rikers training and experience in digital storytelling, and minimal
programming. The workshop will run for five Saturdays and includes
undergraduate students from Columbia. On the storytelling front, we focus on
#RikersIsnthome---a hashtag that emerged from our conversation at the first
gathering. On the programming front, we will design and implement a bot that
will tweet the storyline (@rikersbot). As we set up the story-writing and
programming apparatus, we work in teams divided into Editors, Producers and
Programmers. We will credit the young people in the program here, and provide
them with proper accredition for participating.
