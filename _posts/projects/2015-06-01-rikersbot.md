*RikersBot* is a coding workshop and an algorithmic storytelling project set
in and about Rikers Island correctional facility, New York city's main jail
complex. Follow us [@rikersbot](https://twitter.com/rikersbot).

In the spring of 2015, the [Center for
Justice](http://centerforjustice.columbia.edu/) approached the [Experimental
Methods Group](http://xpmethod.plaintext.in/) with an idea of running an "Intro
to [Python](https://www.python.org/)" workshop for the young people
incarcerated at Rikers and for Columbia University students interested in
digital literacy.  It was important for us to set up the encounter in a way
that moves past one way conversation with effects that persist beyond the one
time event.

In teaching programming through digital storytelling, it is our hope to
encourage a dialog between the youth at Rikers, Columbia faculty and students,
and the community at large.

The RikersBot project gives all participants a chance to have their voices
heard, to learn to code, and to gain real-world experience in writing, editing,
and producing a project. Together, we are building a [Twitter
bot](https://twitter.com/rikersbot) that will tell our story.
