## Description

*Rikers Bot* is a coding workshop and an algorithmic storytelling event set in
and about Rikers Island correctional facility, New York city's main jail
complex. Follow us [@rikersbot](https://twitter.com/rikersbot)!

In the spring of 2015, the [Center for Justice
Justice](http://centerforjustice.columbia.edu/) approached the [Experimental
Methods Group] with an idea of running a coding workshop for the young people
incarcerated at Rikers and for CU students interested in digital literacy. It
was important for us to set up the encounter in a way that moves past a one way
conversation with effects that persist beyond the one time event.

In teaching programming through digital storytelling, it is our hope to set up
a dialog between the youth at Rikers, Columbia faculty and students, and the
community at large.

The RikersBot project gives all participants a chance to have their voices
heard, to learn to code, and to gain real-world experience in writing, editing,
and producing a story. We are just getting star
