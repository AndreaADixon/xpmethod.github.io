Plain text is a file format and a frame of mind. A fundamental concept in the development of computing, plain text stands in opposition to closed platforms, rarefied knowledge, and black-box devices. Instead, it offers a vision of data that is human-readable by design: portable, concise, and universal. This book contains an argument for plain text, seeking to empower a community of students, scholars, authors, publishers, librarians, citizens, and activists by re-evaluating the ideas, tools and practices that shape our daily encounter with computation.
