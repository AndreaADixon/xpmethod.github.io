The group does not maintain an official membership list. This page is generated automatically by polling activity in the "research-strains" portion of the website. The price of admission is, therefore, collaboration. Join us by filing a merge request to our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/xpmethod/xpmethod.github.io), or email one of our faculty advisors to find out how you can get involved!
